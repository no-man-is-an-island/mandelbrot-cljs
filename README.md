# Mandelbrot CLJS

A (mostly!) clojurescript interactive [Mandelbrot Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) visualisation using a HTML5 canvas.

The demo can be found at [http://mandelbrot.davidwilliams.london](http://mandelbrot.davidwilliams.london)

## Instructions

* Click (mainly for mobile) or select an area to zoom in.
* Ctrl-Z/Undo to undo the last thing you did (thanks functional programming!)
* Ctrl-I/Get Image to generate a PNG of the canvas
* Reset (or just refresh the page) to get back to the original zoom level 
* Toggle Stats - Display/hide a box showing stats about rendering speed, zoom level etc.

## Technical Stuff

I cribbed some help with the (sometimes impenetrable) Canvas API (and found the [iteration smoothing technique](http://linas.org/art-gallery/escape/escape.html) for extra prettiness in the rendering) in [cslarsen's javascript mandelbrot implementation](https://github.com/cslarsen/mandelbrot-js). Almost everything else has been done from first principles.

I started with a pure clojurescript implementation, but I couldn't speed it up sufficiently without mutable state. I played around with [swannodette's macros for this](https://github.com/swannodette/chambered/blob/master/src/chambered/macros.clj) which use arrays of length one as mutable state, but it was still around 10 times slower than a pure javascript version. Hence, the 'hard maths' of iterating the complex number operations is done in a small javascript library and the user interaction, re-rendering etc. is done in clojurescript.

The number of iterations (i.e. the 'precision' of the rendering) is set to increase logarithmically with the 'level' of zoom (i.e. the number of pixels a distance of 1 in the complex plane takes up). I don't know if there's a theoretical basis for this, but it seems to work quite well. If you zoom in enough the limits of floating point precision break the visualisation (when the number of pixels representing a distance of 1 reaches around 1 billion billion)

You will need to compile the clojurescript to be able to run this - I've been using [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) for dynamic development.
